# Ayouken

IRC bot. Currently training to become a fight irc game engine.

## How to deal with it

Clone it. Install it. Do it

```shell
# Check you're using ruby 2
git clone git@github.com:webdevesgi/ayouken.git
cd ayouken
bundle install
ruby app.rb
```

Change default IRC channel with yours in `app.rb`.
